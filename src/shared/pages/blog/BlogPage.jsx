Refresh tokens are typically used to access resources that are needed for a longer period of time, such as a user's calendar or a list of files.</p>

                                <p className="mt-4 text-base text-gray-400">Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for building web applications. It is designed to be easy to use and extend, and it is used by a large number of developers worldwide.

                                    Nest.js is a framework built on top of Express.js that provides a more opinionated and structured approach to building web applications. It uses TypeScript, which is a superset of JavaScript that provides a number of benefits, such as type safety and improved tooling. Nest.js also provides a number of features that make it easier to build scalable and maintainable web applications, such as dependency injection, routing, and modules.</p>

                                <p className="mt-4 text-base text-gray-400">
                                    MongoDB aggregate is a feature that allows you to perform complex operations on your data. It uses a pipeline of stages to process your data, and each stage can perform a different operation. For example, you can use the $match stage to filter your data, the $group stage to group your data, and the $project stage to project your data.

                                    To use MongoDB aggregate, you need to use the db.collection.aggregate() method. This method takes an array of stages as its argument. The stages are executed in order, and the output of each stage is passed to the next stage.</p>
